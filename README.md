# Advent of Code 🎄⭐

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

# My Advent of Code usage 👨‍💻

I use Advent of Code to practice algorithms and problem solving.

I try to not use ChatGPT or any AI that could solve the puzzle for me.

The only use of AIs is to correct myself, improve my code and learn at the same time.

# How to run the solutions

To run the solutions, you'll need to install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then open a Terminal in the desired solution folder

Run the solution : 
```
go run main.go
```
